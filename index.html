                <h3>How My Day Is Going</h3>

                    Today was just meant for me to get things done. You know, really get
                    things done and that hasn't really been the case in a pretty long time,
                    so let me get started on how that's going. We made some chicken vindaloo
                    during the first few hours of the day and really got into how cooking
                    can really make a difference in your life. Just taking the time to make
                    something good and you don't exactly how it's going to turn out, is
                    probably something that loving parents would say later in their life. In
                    a way, that gets you thinking that there are some aspects to people
                    you'll never really get to see, and that's okay I think. You can enjoy
                    someone in their most concrete self, but come to appreciate those
                    moments when they reveal something to you that you didn't know about
                    them before. It's an exercise, I think. Anyway, it was nice to get that
                    bit out, and it was probably just straight up unintelligble for some
                    people, and you know what? <strong>That's okay as well.</strong>

                    If you can say anything about someone and push back the fact that it
                    could be completely untrue and not the case at all what would it be? It
                    seems like it could just be about anything, I mean, the whole thought I
                    was probably trying to get at was that you could literally say anything
                    about anyone, and there isn't a framework you could use but the one
                    where your mind lives. Things have been getting into my mind where it's
                    like I don't really care if my reality is fake or not, because I'm just
                    going to kill the self that I live in right now, and that's pretty
                    hardcore. <em>Maybe?</em>
                    I don't mind how things turn out, but I do mind if I start to come into
                    a realization that I'm going to not be living the way I was living the
                    past few months. That's weird. I like to think I'm a pretty grounded
                    person, but some things that are coming into my head lately are starting
                    to make me feel a bit uncertain about how I should move. This was all
                    started with me watching my roommate as they proceeded to not wash their
                    rice before they cooked it. I don't know how to explain that much
                    further.
