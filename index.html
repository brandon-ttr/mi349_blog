        <h3>How My Day Is Going</h3>
        <h5>Author: Brandon Truong</h5>
        <h6>Date Published: October 16, 2022</h6>
        <p>
            Today was just meant for me to get things done. You know, really get
            things done and that hasn't really been the case in a pretty long time,
            so let me get started on how that's going. We made some chicken vindaloo
            during the first few hours of the day and really got into how cooking
            can really make a difference in your life. Just taking the time to make
            something good and you don't exactly how it's going to turn out, is
            probably something that loving parents would say later in their life. In
            a way, that gets you thinking that there are some aspects to people
            you'll never really get to see, and that's okay I think. You can enjoy
            someone in their most concrete self, but come to appreciate those
            moments when they reveal something to you that you didn't know about
            them before. It's an exercise, I think. Anyway, it was nice to get that
            bit out, and it was probably just straight up unintelligble for some
            people, and you know what? <strong>That's okay as well.</strong>

        <h3>How My Day Went Yesterday</h3>

        <p>
            If you can say anything about someone and push back the fact that it
            could be completely untrue and not the case at all what would it be? It
            seems like it could just be about anything, I mean, the whole thought I
            was probably trying to get at was that you could literally say anything
            about anyone, and there isn't a framework you could use but the one
            where your mind lives. Things have been getting into my mind where it's
            like I don't really care if my reality is fake or not, because I'm just
            going to kill the self that I live in right now, and that's pretty
            hardcore. <em>Maybe?</em>
            I don't mind how things turn out, but I do mind if I start to come into
            a realization that I'm going to not be living the way I was living the
            past few months. That's weird. I like to think I'm a pretty grounded
            person, but some things that are coming into my head lately are starting
            to make me feel a bit uncertain about how I should move. This was all
            started with me watching my roommate as they proceeded to not wash their
            rice before they cooked it. I don't know how to explain that much
            further.
