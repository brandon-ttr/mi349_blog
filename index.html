        <h3>How My Day Is Going</h3>

        <p>
        Today was just meant for me to get things done. You know, really get things done and that hasn't really been the case in a pretty long
        time, so let me get started on how that's going. We made some chicken vindaloo during the first few hours of the day and really got into how
        cooking can really make a difference in your life. Just taking the time to make something good and you don't exactly how it's going to turn out,
        is probably something that loving parents would say later in their life. In a way, that gets you thinking that there are some aspects to people you'll
        never really get to see, and that's okay I think. You can enjoy someone in their most concrete self, but come to appreciate those moments when
        they reveal something to you that you didn't know about them before. It's an exercise, I think. Anyway, it was nice to get that bit out, and it was
        probably just straight up unintelligble for some people, and you know what? <strong>That's okay as well.</strong>

        <h3>How My Day Went Yesterday</h3>

        If you can say anything about someone and push back the fact that it could be completely untrue and not the case at all what would it be?
        It seems like it could just be about anything, I mean, the whole thought I was probably trying to get at was that you could literally say anything
        about anyone, and there isn't a framework you could use but the one where your mind lives. Things have been getting into my mind where it's like
        I don't really care if my reality is fake or not, because I'm just going to kill the self that I live in right now, and that's pretty hardcore. <em>Maybe?</em>
        I don't mind how things turn out, but I do mind if I start to come into a realization that I'm going to not be living the way I was living the past
        few months. That's weird. I like to think I'm a pretty grounded person, but some things that are coming into my head lately are starting to make me
        feel a bit uncertain about how I should move. This was all started with me watching my roommate as they proceeded to not wash their rice before they cooked it.
        I don't know how to explain that much further.
