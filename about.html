    <h6>That's Another Brandon Truong by the way</h6>
    <p>People say I'm working, but I say I'm not working. I'm not sure where I was going with that, but take it as some wiseman speech</p>
    <p>I love working with people that have ideas and wants for the future and the things they make. Well, I also love making things with
        people that want nothing more than to just indulge their impulsive nature when it comes to random scripts, you really don't have to make anything
        useful. I mean, you don't gotta do anything. I mean, just work on a project with me. I mean, please help me learn things so I can feel
        more validated with my ability to do things.
